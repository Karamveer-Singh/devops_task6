# devops_task6
Deploy a simple HTML website using GitHub Pages.

By Guru Sahib Ji's grace above task was tried by creating index.html and about.html with little CSS content.

Basically the link of the static website was obtained under "devops_task6" repository on github, followed by "Settings" > "Pages" > selecting Branch and folder under "Build and deployment" > Save. This results in providing a link to website: https://karamveer-singh.github.io/devops_task6/

Screenshots were added for the followed procedure
thanks
